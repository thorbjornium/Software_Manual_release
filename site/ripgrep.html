<p>ripgrep 14.1.1 (rev 4649aa9700)
Andrew Gallant <a href="mailto:jamslam@gmail.com">jamslam@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>ripgrep (rg) recursively searches the current directory for lines matching
a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and
automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files.</p>
<p>Use -h for short descriptions and --help for more details.</p>
<p>Project home page: <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep</a></p>
<p>USAGE:
rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]
rg [OPTIONS] -e PATTERN ... [PATH ...]
rg [OPTIONS] -f PATTERNFILE ... [PATH ...]
rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH ...]
rg [OPTIONS] --type-list
command | rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN
rg [OPTIONS] --help
rg [OPTIONS] --version</p>
<p>POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS:
<PATTERN>
A regular expression used for searching. To match a pattern beginning
with a dash, use the -e/--regexp flag.</p>
<pre><code>    For example, to search for the literal '-foo', you can use this flag:

        rg -e -foo

    You can also use the special '--' delimiter to indicate that no more
    flags will be provided. Namely, the following is equivalent to the
    above:

        rg -- -foo

&lt;PATH&gt;...
    A file or directory to search. Directories are searched recursively.
    File paths specified on the command line override glob and ignore
    rules.
</code></pre>
<p>INPUT OPTIONS:
-e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN
A pattern to search for. This option can be provided multiple times,
where all patterns given are searched, in addition to any patterns
provided by -f/--file. Lines matching at least one of the provided
patterns are printed. This flag can also be used when searching for
patterns that start with a dash.</p>
<pre><code>    For example, to search for the literal -foo:

        rg -e -foo

    You can also use the special -- delimiter to indicate that no more
    flags will be provided. Namely, the following is equivalent to the
    above:

        rg -- -foo

    When -f/--file or -e/--regexp is used, then ripgrep treats all
    positional arguments as files or directories to search.

-f PATTERNFILE, --file=PATTERNFILE
    Search for patterns from the given file, with one pattern per line.
    When this flag is used multiple times or in combination with the
    -e/--regexp flag, then all patterns provided are searched. Empty
    pattern lines will match all input lines, and the newline is not
    counted as part of the pattern.

    A line is printed if and only if it matches at least one of the
    patterns.

    When PATTERNFILE is -, then stdin will be read for the patterns.

    When -f/--file or -e/--regexp is used, then ripgrep treats all
    positional arguments as files or directories to search.

--pre=COMMAND
    For each input PATH, this flag causes ripgrep to search the standard
    output of COMMAND PATH instead of the contents of PATH. This option
    expects the COMMAND program to either be a path or to be available in
    your PATH. Either an empty string COMMAND or the --no-pre flag will
    disable this behavior.

    WARNING: When this flag is set, ripgrep will unconditionally spawn a
    process for every file that is searched. Therefore, this can incur an
    unnecessarily large performance penalty if you don't otherwise need the
    flexibility offered by this flag. One possible mitigation to this is to
    use the --pre-glob flag to limit which files a preprocessor is run
    with.

    A preprocessor is not run when ripgrep is searching stdin.

    When searching over sets of files that may require one of several
    preprocessors, COMMAND should be a wrapper program which first
    classifies PATH based on magic numbers/content or based on the PATH
    name and then dispatches to an appropriate preprocessor. Each COMMAND
    also has its standard input connected to PATH for convenience.

    For example, a shell script for COMMAND might look like:

        case "$1" in
        *.pdf)
            exec pdftotext "$1" -
            ;;
        *)
            case $(file "$1") in
            *Zstandard*)
                exec pzstd -cdq
                ;;
            *)
                exec cat
                ;;
            esac
            ;;
        esac

    The above script uses pdftotext to convert a PDF file to plain text.
    For all other files, the script uses the file utility to sniff the type
    of the file based on its contents. If it is a compressed file in the
    Zstandard format, then pzstd is used to decompress the contents to
    stdout.

    This overrides the -z/--search-zip flag.

--pre-glob=GLOB
    This flag works in conjunction with the --pre flag. Namely, when one or
    more --pre-glob flags are given, then only files that match the given
    set of globs will be handed to the command specified by the --pre flag.
    Any non-matching files will be searched without using the preprocessor
    command.

    This flag is useful when searching many files with the --pre flag.
    Namely, it provides the ability to avoid process overhead for files
    that don't need preprocessing. For example, given the following shell
    script, pre-pdftotext:

        #!/bin/sh
        pdftotext "$1" -

    then it is possible to use --pre pre-pdftotext --pre-glob '*.pdf' to
    make it so ripgrep only executes the pre-pdftotext command on files
    with a .pdf extension.

    Multiple --pre-glob flags may be used. Globbing rules match gitignore
    globs. Precede a glob with a ! to exclude it.

    This flag has no effect if the --pre flag is not used.

-z, --search-zip
    This flag instructs ripgrep to search in compressed files. Currently
    gzip, bzip2, xz, LZ4, LZMA, Brotli and Zstd files are supported. This
    option expects the decompression binaries (such as gzip) to be
    available in your PATH. If the required binaries are not found, then
    ripgrep will not emit an error messages by default. Use the --debug
    flag to see more information.

    Note that this flag does not make ripgrep search archive formats as
    directory trees. It only makes ripgrep detect compressed files and then
    decompress them before searching their contents as it would any other
    file.

    This overrides the --pre flag.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-search-zip.
</code></pre>
<p>SEARCH OPTIONS:
-s, --case-sensitive
Execute the search case sensitively. This is the default mode.</p>
<pre><code>    This is a global option that applies to all patterns given to ripgrep.
    Individual patterns can still be matched case insensitively by using
    inline regex flags. For example, (?i)abc will match abc case
    insensitively even when this flag is used.

    This flag overrides the -i/--ignore-case and -S/--smart-case flags.

--crlf
    When enabled, ripgrep will treat CRLF (\r\n) as a line terminator
    instead of just \n.

    Principally, this permits the line anchor assertions ^ and $ in regex
    patterns to treat CRLF, CR or LF as line terminators instead of just
    LF. Note that they will never match between a CR and a LF. CRLF is
    treated as one single line terminator.

    When using the default regex engine, CRLF support can also be enabled
    inside the pattern with the R flag. For example, (?R:$) will match just
    before either CR or LF, but never between CR and LF.

    This flag overrides --null-data.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-crlf.

--dfa-size-limit=NUM+SUFFIX?
    The upper size limit of the regex DFA. The default limit is something
    generous for any single pattern or for many smallish patterns. This
    should only be changed on very large regex inputs where the (slower)
    fallback regex engine may otherwise be used if the limit is reached.

    The input format accepts suffixes of K, M or G which correspond to
    kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes, respectively. If no suffix is
    provided the input is treated as bytes.

-E ENCODING, --encoding=ENCODING
    Specify the text encoding that ripgrep will use on all files searched.
    The default value is auto, which will cause ripgrep to do a best effort
    automatic detection of encoding on a per-file basis. Automatic
    detection in this case only applies to files that begin with a UTF-8 or
    UTF-16 byte-order mark (BOM). No other automatic detection is
    performed. One can also specify none which will then completely disable
    BOM sniffing and always result in searching the raw bytes, including a
    BOM if it's present, regardless of its encoding.

    Other supported values can be found in the list of labels here:
    https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-encoding-get.

    For more details on encoding and how ripgrep deals with it, see
    GUIDE.md.

    The encoding detection that ripgrep uses can be reverted to its
    automatic mode via the --no-encoding flag.

--engine=ENGINE
    Specify which regular expression engine to use. When you choose a regex
    engine, it applies that choice for every regex provided to ripgrep
    (e.g., via multiple -e/--regexp or -f/--file flags).

    Accepted values are default, pcre2, or auto.

    The default value is default, which is usually the fastest and should
    be good for most use cases. The pcre2 engine is generally useful when
    you want to use features such as look-around or backreferences. auto
    will dynamically choose between supported regex engines depending on
    the features used in a pattern on a best effort basis.

    Note that the pcre2 engine is an optional ripgrep feature. If PCRE2
    wasn't included in your build of ripgrep, then using this flag will
    result in ripgrep printing an error message and exiting.

    This overrides previous uses of the -P/--pcre2 and --auto-hybrid-regex
    flags.

-F, --fixed-strings
    Treat all patterns as literals instead of as regular expressions. When
    this flag is used, special regular expression meta characters such as
    .(){}*+ should not need be escaped.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-fixed-strings.

-i, --ignore-case
    When this flag is provided, all patterns will be searched case
    insensitively. The case insensitivity rules used by ripgrep's default
    regex engine conform to Unicode's "simple" case folding rules.

    This is a global option that applies to all patterns given to ripgrep.
    Individual patterns can still be matched case sensitively by using
    inline regex flags. For example, (?-i)abc will match abc case
    sensitively even when this flag is used.

    This flag overrides -s/--case-sensitive and -S/--smart-case.

-v, --invert-match
    This flag inverts matching. That is, instead of printing lines that
    match, ripgrep will print lines that don't match.

    Note that this only inverts line-by-line matching. For example,
    combining this flag with -l/--files-with-matches will emit files that
    contain any lines that do not match the patterns given. That's not the
    same as, for example, --files-without-match, which will emit files that
    do not contain any matching lines.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-invert-match.

-x, --line-regexp
    When enabled, ripgrep will only show matches surrounded by line
    boundaries. This is equivalent to surrounding every pattern with ^ and
    $. In other words, this only prints lines where the entire line
    participates in a match.

    This overrides the -w/--word-regexp flag.

-m NUM, --max-count=NUM
    Limit the number of matching lines per file searched to NUM.

    Note that 0 is a legal value but not likely to be useful. When used,
    ripgrep won't search anything.

--mmap
    When enabled, ripgrep will search using memory maps when possible. This
    is enabled by default when ripgrep thinks it will be faster.

    Memory map searching cannot be used in all circumstances. For example,
    when searching virtual files or streams likes stdin. In such cases,
    memory maps will not be used even when this flag is enabled.

    Note that ripgrep may abort unexpectedly when memory maps are used if
    it searches a file that is simultaneously truncated. Users can opt out
    of this possibility by disabling memory maps.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-mmap.

-U, --multiline
    This flag enable searching across multiple lines.

    When multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that
    a match cannot include a line terminator. For example, when multiline
    mode is not enabled (the default), then the regex \p{any} will match
    any Unicode codepoint other than \n. Similarly, the regex \n is
    explicitly forbidden, and if you try to use it, ripgrep will return an
    error. However, when multiline mode is enabled, \p{any} will match any
    Unicode codepoint, including \n, and regexes like \n are permitted.

    An important caveat is that multiline mode does not change the match
    semantics of .. Namely, in most regex matchers, a . will by default
    match any character other than \n, and this is true in ripgrep as well.
    In order to make . match \n, you must enable the "dot all" flag inside
    the regex. For example, both (?s). and (?s:.) have the same semantics,
    where . will match any character, including \n. Alternatively, the
    --multiline-dotall flag may be passed to make the "dot all" behavior
    the default. This flag only applies when multiline search is enabled.

    There is no limit on the number of the lines that a single match can
    span.

    WARNING: Because of how the underlying regex engine works, multiline
    searches may be slower than normal line-oriented searches, and they may
    also use more memory. In particular, when multiline mode is enabled,
    ripgrep requires that each file it searches is laid out contiguously in
    memory (either by reading it onto the heap or by memory-mapping it).
    Things that cannot be memory-mapped (such as stdin) will be consumed
    until EOF before searching can begin. In general, ripgrep will only do
    these things when necessary. Specifically, if the -U/--multiline flag
    is provided but the regex does not contain patterns that would match \n
    characters, then ripgrep will automatically avoid reading each file
    into memory before searching it. Nevertheless, if you only care about
    matches spanning at most one line, then it is always better to disable
    multiline mode.

    This overrides the --stop-on-nonmatch flag.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-multiline.

--multiline-dotall
    This flag enables "dot all" mode in all regex patterns. This causes .
    to match line terminators when multiline searching is enabled. This
    flag has no effect if multiline searching isn't enabled with the
    -U/--multiline flag.

    Normally, a . will match any character except line terminators. While
    this behavior typically isn't relevant for line-oriented matching
    (since matches can span at most one line), this can be useful when
    searching with the -U/--multiline flag. By default, multiline mode runs
    without "dot all" mode enabled.

    This flag is generally intended to be used in an alias or your ripgrep
    config file if you prefer "dot all" semantics by default. Note that
    regardless of whether this flag is used, "dot all" semantics can still
    be controlled via inline flags in the regex pattern itself, e.g.,
    (?s:.) always enables "dot all" whereas (?-s:.) always disables "dot
    all". Moreover, you can use character classes like \p{any} to match any
    Unicode codepoint regardless of whether "dot all" mode is enabled or
    not.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-multiline-dotall.

--no-unicode
    This flag disables Unicode mode for all patterns given to ripgrep.

    By default, ripgrep will enable "Unicode mode" in all of its regexes.
    This has a number of consequences:

    Œì√á√≥ . will only match valid UTF-8 encoded Unicode scalar values.

    Œì√á√≥ Classes like \w, \s, \d are all Unicode aware and much bigger than
    their ASCII only versions.

    Œì√á√≥ Case insensitive matching will use Unicode case folding.

    Œì√á√≥ A large array of classes like \p{Emoji} are available. (Although the
    specific set of classes available varies based on the regex engine. In
    general, the default regex engine has more classes available to it.)

    Œì√á√≥ Word boundaries (\b and \B) use the Unicode definition of a word
    character.

    In some cases it can be desirable to turn these things off. This flag
    will do exactly that. For example, Unicode mode can sometimes have a
    negative impact on performance, especially when things like \w are used
    frequently (including via bounded repetitions like \w{100}) when only
    their ASCII interpretation is needed.

    This flag can be disabled with --unicode.

--null-data
    Enabling this flag causes ripgrep to use NUL as a line terminator
    instead of the default of \n.

    This is useful when searching large binary files that would otherwise
    have very long lines if \n were used as the line terminator. In
    particular, ripgrep requires that, at a minimum, each line must fit
    into memory. Using NUL instead can be a useful stopgap to keep memory
    requirements low and avoid OOM (out of memory) conditions.

    This is also useful for processing NUL delimited data, such as that
    emitted when using ripgrep's -0/--null flag or find's --print0 flag.

    Using this flag implies -a/--text. It also overrides --crlf.

-P, --pcre2
    When this flag is present, ripgrep will use the PCRE2 regex engine
    instead of its default regex engine.

    This is generally useful when you want to use features such as
    look-around or backreferences.

    Using this flag is the same as passing --engine=pcre2. Users may
    instead elect to use --engine=auto to ask ripgrep to automatically
    select the right regex engine based on the patterns given. This flag
    and the --engine flag override one another.

    Note that PCRE2 is an optional ripgrep feature. If PCRE2 wasn't
    included in your build of ripgrep, then using this flag will result in
    ripgrep printing an error message and exiting. PCRE2 may also have
    worse user experience in some cases, since it has fewer introspection
    APIs than ripgrep's default regex engine. For example, if you use a \n
    in a PCRE2 regex without the -U/--multiline flag, then ripgrep will
    silently fail to match anything instead of reporting an error
    immediately (like it does with the default regex engine).

    This flag can be disabled with --no-pcre2.

--regex-size-limit=NUM+SUFFIX?
    The size limit of the compiled regex, where the compiled regex
    generally corresponds to a single object in memory that can match all
    of the patterns provided to ripgrep. The default limit is generous
    enough that most reasonable patterns (or even a small number of them)
    should fit.

    This useful to change when you explicitly want to let ripgrep spend
    potentially much more time and/or memory building a regex matcher.

    The input format accepts suffixes of K, M or G which correspond to
    kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes, respectively. If no suffix is
    provided the input is treated as bytes.

-S, --smart-case
    This flag instructs ripgrep to searches case insensitively if the
    pattern is all lowercase. Otherwise, ripgrep will search case
    sensitively.

    A pattern is considered all lowercase if both of the following rules
    hold:

    Œì√á√≥ First, the pattern contains at least one literal character. For
    example, a\w contains a literal (a) but just \w does not.

    Œì√á√≥ Second, of the literals in the pattern, none of them are considered
    to be uppercase according to Unicode. For example, foo\pL has no
    uppercase literals but Foo\pL does.

    This overrides the -s/--case-sensitive and -i/--ignore-case flags.

--stop-on-nonmatch
    Enabling this option will cause ripgrep to stop reading a file once it
    encounters a non-matching line after it has encountered a matching
    line. This is useful if it is expected that all matches in a given file
    will be on sequential lines, for example due to the lines being sorted.

    This overrides the -U/--multiline flag.

-a, --text
    This flag instructs ripgrep to search binary files as if they were
    text. When this flag is present, ripgrep's binary file detection is
    disabled. This means that when a binary file is searched, its contents
    may be printed if there is a match. This may cause escape codes to be
    printed that alter the behavior of your terminal.

    When binary file detection is enabled, it is imperfect. In general, it
    uses a simple heuristic. If a NUL byte is seen during search, then the
    file is considered binary and searching stops (unless this flag is
    present). Alternatively, if the --binary flag is used, then ripgrep
    will only quit when it sees a NUL byte after it sees a match (or
    searches the entire file).

    This flag overrides the --binary flag.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-text.

-j NUM, --threads=NUM
    This flag sets the approximate number of threads to use. A value of 0
    (which is the default) causes ripgrep to choose the thread count using
    heuristics.

-w, --word-regexp
    When enabled, ripgrep will only show matches surrounded by word
    boundaries. This is equivalent to surrounding every pattern with
    \b{start-half} and \b{end-half}.

    This overrides the -x/--line-regexp flag.

--auto-hybrid-regex
    DEPRECATED. Use --engine instead.

    When this flag is used, ripgrep will dynamically choose between
    supported regex engines depending on the features used in a pattern.
    When ripgrep chooses a regex engine, it applies that choice for every
    regex provided to ripgrep (e.g., via multiple -e/--regexp or -f/--file
    flags).

    As an example of how this flag might behave, ripgrep will attempt to
    use its default finite automata based regex engine whenever the pattern
    can be successfully compiled with that regex engine. If PCRE2 is
    enabled and if the pattern given could not be compiled with the default
    regex engine, then PCRE2 will be automatically used for searching. If
    PCRE2 isn't available, then this flag has no effect because there is
    only one regex engine to choose from.

    In the future, ripgrep may adjust its heuristics for how it decides
    which regex engine to use. In general, the heuristics will be limited
    to a static analysis of the patterns, and not to any specific runtime
    behavior observed while searching files.

    The primary downside of using this flag is that it may not always be
    obvious which regex engine ripgrep uses, and thus, the match semantics
    or performance profile of ripgrep may subtly and unexpectedly change.
    However, in many cases, all regex engines will agree on what
    constitutes a match and it can be nice to transparently support more
    advanced regex features like look-around and backreferences without
    explicitly needing to enable them.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-auto-hybrid-regex.

--no-pcre2-unicode
    DEPRECATED. Use --no-unicode instead.

    Note that Unicode mode is enabled by default.

    This flag can be disabled with --pcre2-unicode.
</code></pre>
<p>FILTER OPTIONS:
--binary
Enabling this flag will cause ripgrep to search binary files. By
default, ripgrep attempts to automatically skip binary files in order
to improve the relevance of results and make the search faster.</p>
<pre><code>    Binary files are heuristically detected based on whether they contain a
    NUL byte or not. By default (without this flag set), once a NUL: byte
    is seen, ripgrep will stop searching the file. Usually, NUL bytes occur
    in the beginning of most binary files. If a NUL byte occurs after a
    match, then ripgrep will not print the match, stop searching that file,
    and emit a warning that some matches are being suppressed.

    In contrast, when this flag is provided, ripgrep will continue
    searching a file even if a NUL byte is found. In particular, if a NUL
    byte is found then ripgrep will continue searching until either a match
    is found or the end of the file is reached, whichever comes sooner. If
    a match is found, then ripgrep will stop and print a warning saying
    that the search stopped prematurely.

    If you want ripgrep to search a file without any special NUL byte
    handling at all (and potentially print binary data to stdout), then you
    should use the -a/--text flag.

    The --binary flag is a flag for controlling ripgrep's automatic
    filtering mechanism. As such, it does not need to be used when
    searching a file explicitly or when searching stdin. That is, it is
    only applicable when recursively searching a directory.

    When the -u/--unrestricted flag is provided for a third time, then this
    flag is automatically enabled.

    This flag overrides the -a/--text flag.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-binary.

-L, --follow
    This flag instructs ripgrep to follow symbolic links while traversing
    directories. This behavior is disabled by default. Note that ripgrep
    will check for symbolic link loops and report errors if it finds one.
    ripgrep will also report errors for broken links. To suppress error
    messages, use the --no-messages flag.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-follow.

-g GLOB, --glob=GLOB
    Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the
    given glob. This always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob
    flags may be used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a
    glob with a ! to exclude it. If multiple globs match a file or
    directory, the glob given later in the command line takes precedence.

    As an extension, globs support specifying alternatives: "-g'"ab{c,d}*'
    is equivalent to "-g""abc""-g"abd. Empty alternatives like "-g'"ab{,c}'
    are not currently supported. Note that this syntax extension is also
    currently enabled in gitignore files, even though this syntax isn't
    supported by git itself. ripgrep may disable this syntax extension in
    gitignore files, but it will always remain available via the -g/--glob
    flag.

    When this flag is set, every file and directory is applied to it to
    test for a match. For example, if you only want to search in a
    particular directory foo, then "-g"foo is incorrect because foo/bar
    does not match the glob foo. Instead, you should use "-g'"foo/**'.

--glob-case-insensitive
    Process all glob patterns given with the -g/--glob flag case
    insensitively. This effectively treats -g/--glob as --iglob.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-glob-case-insensitive.

-., --hidden
    Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and
    directories are skipped. Note that if a hidden file or a directory is
    whitelisted in an ignore file, then it will be searched even if this
    flag isn't provided. Similarly if a hidden file or directory is given
    explicitly as an argument to ripgrep.

    A file or directory is considered hidden if its base name starts with a
    dot character (.). On operating systems which support a "hidden" file
    attribute, like Windows, files with this attribute are also considered
    hidden.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-hidden.

--iglob=GLOB
    Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the
    given glob. This always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob
    flags may be used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a
    glob with a ! to exclude it. If multiple globs match a file or
    directory, the glob given later in the command line takes precedence.
    Globs used via this flag are matched case insensitively.

--ignore-file=PATH
    Specifies a path to one or more gitignore formatted rules files. These
    patterns are applied after the patterns found in .gitignore, .rgignore
    and .ignore are applied and are matched relative to the current working
    directory. Multiple additional ignore files can be specified by using
    this flag repeatedly. When specifying multiple ignore files, earlier
    files have lower precedence than later files.

    If you are looking for a way to include or exclude files and
    directories directly on the command line, then use -g/--glob instead.

--ignore-file-case-insensitive
    Process ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) case insensitively.
    Note that this comes with a performance penalty and is most useful on
    case insensitive file systems (such as Windows).

    This flag can be disabled with --no-ignore-file-case-insensitive.

-d NUM, --max-depth=NUM
    This flag limits the depth of directory traversal to NUM levels beyond
    the paths given. A value of 0 only searches the explicitly given paths
    themselves.

    For example, rg --max-depth 0 dir/ is a no-op because dir/ will not be
    descended into. rg --max-depth 1 dir/ will search only the direct
    children of dir.

    An alternative spelling for this flag is --maxdepth.

--max-filesize=NUM+SUFFIX?
    Ignore files larger than NUM in size. This does not apply to
    directories.

    The input format accepts suffixes of K, M or G which correspond to
    kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes, respectively. If no suffix is
    provided the input is treated as bytes.

    Examples: --max-filesize 50K or --max-filesize 80M.

--no-ignore
    When set, ignore files such as .gitignore, .ignore and .rgignore will
    not be respected. This implies --no-ignore-dot, --no-ignore-exclude,
    --no-ignore-global, --no-ignore-parent and --no-ignore-vcs.

    This does not imply --no-ignore-files, since --ignore-file is specified
    explicitly as a command line argument.

    When given only once, the -u/--unrestricted flag is identical in
    behavior to this flag and can be considered an alias. However,
    subsequent -u/--unrestricted flags have additional effects.

    This flag can be disabled with --ignore.

--no-ignore-dot
    Don't respect filter rules from .ignore or .rgignore files.

    This does not impact whether ripgrep will ignore files and directories
    whose names begin with a dot. For that, see the -./--hidden flag. This
    flag also does not impact whether filter rules from .gitignore files
    are respected.

    This flag can be disabled with --ignore-dot.

--no-ignore-exclude
    Don't respect filter rules from files that are manually configured for
    the repository. For example, this includes git's .git/info/exclude.

    This flag can be disabled with --ignore-exclude.

--no-ignore-files
    When set, any --ignore-file flags, even ones that come after this flag,
    are ignored.

    This flag can be disabled with --ignore-files.

--no-ignore-global
    Don't respect filter rules from ignore files that come from "global"
    sources such as git's core.excludesFile configuration option (which
    defaults to $HOME/.config/git/ignore).

    This flag can be disabled with --ignore-global.

--no-ignore-parent
    When this flag is set, filter rules from ignore files found in parent
    directories are not respected. By default, ripgrep will ascend the
    parent directories of the current working directory to look for any
    applicable ignore files that should be applied. In some cases this may
    not be desirable.

    This flag can be disabled with --ignore-parent.

--no-ignore-vcs
    When given, filter rules from source control ignore files (e.g.,
    .gitignore) are not respected. By default, ripgrep respects git's
    ignore rules for automatic filtering. In some cases, it may not be
    desirable to respect the source control's ignore rules and instead only
    respect rules in .ignore or .rgignore.

    This flag implies --no-ignore-parent for source control ignore files as
    well.

    This flag can be disabled with --ignore-vcs.

--no-require-git
    When this flag is given, source control ignore files such as .gitignore
    are respected even if no git repository is present.

    By default, ripgrep will only respect filter rules from source control
    ignore files when ripgrep detects that the search is executed inside a
    source control repository. For example, when a .git directory is
    observed.

    This flag relaxes the default restriction. For example, it might be
    useful when the contents of a git repository are stored or copied
    somewhere, but where the repository state is absent.

    This flag can be disabled with --require-git.

--one-file-system
    When enabled, ripgrep will not cross file system boundaries relative to
    where the search started from.

    Note that this applies to each path argument given to ripgrep. For
    example, in the command

        rg --one-file-system /foo/bar /quux/baz

    ripgrep will search both /foo/bar and /quux/baz even if they are on
    different file systems, but will not cross a file system boundary when
    traversing each path's directory tree.

    This is similar to find's -xdev or -mount flag.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-one-file-system.

-t TYPE, --type=TYPE
    This flag limits ripgrep to searching files matching TYPE. Multiple
    -t/--type flags may be provided.

    This flag supports the special value all, which will behave as if
    -t/--type was provided for every file type supported by ripgrep
    (including any custom file types). The end result is that --type=all
    causes ripgrep to search in "whitelist" mode, where it will only search
    files it recognizes via its type definitions.

    Note that this flag has lower precedence than both the -g/--glob flag
    and any rules found in ignore files.

    To see the list of available file types, use the --type-list flag.

-T TYPE, --type-not=TYPE
    Do not search files matching TYPE. Multiple -T/--type-not flags may be
    provided. Use the --type-list flag to list all available types.

    This flag supports the special value all, which will behave as if
    -T/--type-not was provided for every file type supported by ripgrep
    (including any custom file types). The end result is that
    --type-not=all causes ripgrep to search in "blacklist" mode, where it
    will only search files that are unrecognized by its type definitions.

    To see the list of available file types, use the --type-list flag.

--type-add=TYPESPEC
    This flag adds a new glob for a particular file type. Only one glob can
    be added at a time. Multiple --type-add flags can be provided. Unless
    --type-clear is used, globs are added to any existing globs defined
    inside of ripgrep.

    Note that this must be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type
    settings are not persisted. See CONFIGURATION FILES for a workaround.

    Example:

        rg --type-add 'foo:*.foo' -tfoo PATTERN

    This flag can also be used to include rules from other types with the
    special include directive. The include directive permits specifying one
    or more other type names (separated by a comma) that have been defined
    and its rules will automatically be imported into the type specified.
    For example, to create a type called src that matches C++, Python and
    Markdown files, one can use:

        --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md'

    Additional glob rules can still be added to the src type by using this
    flag again:

        --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md' --type-add 'src:*.foo'

    Note that type names must consist only of Unicode letters or numbers.
    Punctuation characters are not allowed.

--type-clear=TYPE
    Clear the file type globs previously defined for TYPE. This clears any
    previously defined globs for the TYPE, but globs can be added after
    this flag.

    Note that this must be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type
    settings are not persisted. See CONFIGURATION FILES for a workaround.

-u, --unrestricted
    This flag reduces the level of "smart" filtering. Repeated uses (up to
    3) reduces the filtering even more. When repeated three times, ripgrep
    will search every file in a directory tree.

    A single -u/--unrestricted flag is equivalent to --no-ignore. Two
    -u/--unrestricted flags is equivalent to --no-ignore -./--hidden. Three
    -u/--unrestricted flags is equivalent to --no-ignore -./--hidden
    --binary.

    The only filtering ripgrep still does when -uuu is given is to skip
    symbolic links and to avoid printing matches from binary files.
    Symbolic links can be followed via the -L/--follow flag, and binary
    files can be treated as text files via the -a/--text flag.
</code></pre>
<p>OUTPUT OPTIONS:
-A NUM, --after-context=NUM
Show NUM lines after each match.</p>
<pre><code>    This overrides the --passthru flag and partially overrides the
    -C/--context flag.

-B NUM, --before-context=NUM
    Show NUM lines before each match.

    This overrides the --passthru flag and partially overrides the
    -C/--context flag.

--block-buffered
    When enabled, ripgrep will use block buffering. That is, whenever a
    matching line is found, it will be written to an in-memory buffer and
    will not be written to stdout until the buffer reaches a certain size.
    This is the default when ripgrep's stdout is redirected to a pipeline
    or a file. When ripgrep's stdout is connected to a tty, line buffering
    will be used by default. Forcing block buffering can be useful when
    dumping a large amount of contents to a tty.

    This overrides the --line-buffered flag.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-block-buffered.

-b, --byte-offset
    Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file before each line of
    output. If -o/--only-matching is specified, print the offset of the
    matched text itself.

    If ripgrep does transcoding, then the byte offset is in terms of the
    result of transcoding and not the original data. This applies similarly
    to other transformations on the data, such as decompression or a --pre
    filter.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-byte-offset.

--color=WHEN
    This flag controls when to use colors. The default setting is auto,
    which means ripgrep will try to guess when to use colors. For example,
    if ripgrep is printing to a tty, then it will use colors, but if it is
    redirected to a file or a pipe, then it will suppress color output.

    ripgrep will suppress color output by default in some other
    circumstances as well. These include, but are not limited to:

    Œì√á√≥ When the TERM environment variable is not set or set to dumb.

    Œì√á√≥ When the NO_COLOR environment variable is set (regardless of value).

    Œì√á√≥ When flags that imply no use for colors are given. For example,
    --vimgrep and --json.

    The possible values for this flag are:

    never: Colors will never be used.

    auto: The default. ripgrep tries to be smart.

    always: Colors will always be used regardless of where output is sent.

    ansi: Like 'always', but emits ANSI escapes (even in a Windows
    console).

    This flag also controls whether hyperlinks are emitted. For example,
    when a hyperlink format is specified, hyperlinks won't be used when
    color is suppressed. If one wants to emit hyperlinks but no colors,
    then one must use the --colors flag to manually set all color styles to
    none:

        --colors 'path:none' \
        --colors 'line:none' \
        --colors 'column:none' \
        --colors 'match:none'

--colors=COLOR_SPEC
    This flag specifies color settings for use in the output. This flag may
    be provided multiple times. Settings are applied iteratively.
    Pre-existing color labels are limited to one of eight choices: red,
    blue, green, cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black. Styles are limited
    to nobold, bold, nointense, intense, nounderline or underline.

    The format of the flag is {type}:{attribute}:{value}. type should be
    one of path, line, column or match. attribute can be fg, bg or style.
    value is either a color (for fg and bg) or a text style. A special
    format, {type}:none, will clear all color settings for type.

    For example, the following command will change the match color to
    magenta and the background color for line numbers to yellow:

        rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow'

    Extended colors can be used for value when the tty supports ANSI color
    sequences. These are specified as either x (256-color) or x,x,x (24-bit
    truecolor) where x is a number between 0 and 255 inclusive. x may be
    given as a normal decimal number or a hexadecimal number, which is
    prefixed by 0x.

    For example, the following command will change the match background
    color to that represented by the rgb value (0,128,255):

        rg --colors 'match:bg:0,128,255'

    or, equivalently,

        rg --colors 'match:bg:0x0,0x80,0xFF'

    Note that the intense and nointense styles will have no effect when
    used alongside these extended color codes.

--column
    Show column numbers (1-based). This only shows the column numbers for
    the first match on each line. This does not try to account for Unicode.
    One byte is equal to one column. This implies -n/--line-number.

    When -o/--only-matching is used, then the column numbers written
    correspond to the start of each match.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-column.

-C NUM, --context=NUM
    Show NUM lines before and after each match. This is equivalent to
    providing both the -B/--before-context and -A/--after-context flags
    with the same value.

    This overrides the --passthru flag. The -A/--after-context and
    -B/--before-context flags both partially override this flag, regardless
    of the order. For example, -A2 -C1 is equivalent to -A2 -B1.

--context-separator=SEPARATOR
    The string used to separate non-contiguous context lines in the output.
    This is only used when one of the context flags is used (that is,
    -A/--after-context, -B/--before-context or -C/--context). Escape
    sequences like \x7F or \t may be used. The default value is --.

    When the context separator is set to an empty string, then a line break
    is still inserted. To completely disable context separators, use the
    --no-context-separator flag.

--field-context-separator=SEPARATOR
    Set the field context separator. This separator is only used when
    printing contextual lines. It is used to delimit file paths, line
    numbers, columns and the contextual line itself. The separator may be
    any number of bytes, including zero. Escape sequences like \x7F or \t
    may be used.

    The - character is the default value.

--field-match-separator=SEPARATOR
    Set the field match separator. This separator is only used when
    printing matching lines. It is used to delimit file paths, line
    numbers, columns and the matching line itself. The separator may be any
    number of bytes, including zero. Escape sequences like \x7F or \t may
    be used.

    The : character is the default value.

--heading
    This flag prints the file path above clusters of matches from each file
    instead of printing the file path as a prefix for each matched line.

    This is the default mode when printing to a tty.

    When stdout is not a tty, then ripgrep will default to the standard
    grep-like format. One can force this format in Unix-like environments
    by piping the output of ripgrep to cat. For example, rg foo | cat.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-heading.

-h, --help
    This flag prints the help output for ripgrep.

    Unlike most other flags, the behavior of the short flag, -h, and the
    long flag, --help, is different. The short flag will show a condensed
    help output while the long flag will show a verbose help output. The
    verbose help output has complete documentation, where as the condensed
    help output will show only a single line for every flag.

--hostname-bin=COMMAND
    This flag controls how ripgrep determines this system's hostname. The
    flag's value should correspond to an executable (either a path or
    something that can be found via your system's PATH environment
    variable). When set, ripgrep will run this executable, with no
    arguments, and treat its output (with leading and trailing whitespace
    stripped) as your system's hostname.

    When not set (the default, or the empty string), ripgrep will try to
    automatically detect your system's hostname. On Unix, this corresponds
    to calling gethostname. On Windows, this corresponds to calling
    GetComputerNameExW to fetch the system's "physical DNS hostname."

    ripgrep uses your system's hostname for producing hyperlinks.

--hyperlink-format=FORMAT
    Set the format of hyperlinks to use when printing results. Hyperlinks
    make certain elements of ripgrep's output, such as file paths,
    clickable. This generally only works in terminal emulators that support
    OSC-8 hyperlinks. For example, the format file://{host}{path} will emit
    an RFC 8089 hyperlink. To see the format that ripgrep is using, pass
    the --debug flag.

    Alternatively, a format string may correspond to one of the following
    aliases: default, none, file, grep+, kitty, macvim, textmate, vscode,
    vscode-insiders, vscodium. The alias will be replaced with a format
    string that is intended to work for the corresponding application.

    The following variables are available in the format string:

    {path}: Required. This is replaced with a path to a matching file. The
    path is guaranteed to be absolute and percent encoded such that it is
    valid to put into a URI. Note that a path is guaranteed to start with a
    /.

    {host}: Optional. This is replaced with your system's hostname. On
    Unix, this corresponds to calling gethostname. On Windows, this
    corresponds to calling GetComputerNameExW to fetch the system's
    "physical DNS hostname." Alternatively, if --hostname-bin was provided,
    then the hostname returned from the output of that program will be
    returned. If no hostname could be found, then this variable is replaced
    with the empty string.

    {line}: Optional. If appropriate, this is replaced with the line number
    of a match. If no line number is available (for example, if
    --no-line-number was given), then it is automatically replaced with the
    value 1.

    {column}: Optional, but requires the presence of {line}. If
    appropriate, this is replaced with the column number of a match. If no
    column number is available (for example, if --no-column was given),
    then it is automatically replaced with the value 1.

    {wslprefix}: Optional. This is a special value that is set to
    wsl$/WSL_DISTRO_NAME, where WSL_DISTRO_NAME corresponds to the value of
    the equivalent environment variable. If the system is not Unix or if
    the WSL_DISTRO_NAME environment variable is not set, then this is
    replaced with the empty string.

    A format string may be empty. An empty format string is equivalent to
    the none alias. In this case, hyperlinks will be disabled.

    At present, ripgrep does not enable hyperlinks by default. Users must
    opt into them. If you aren't sure what format to use, try default.

    Like colors, when ripgrep detects that stdout is not connected to a
    tty, then hyperlinks are automatically disabled, regardless of the
    value of this flag. Users can pass --color=always to forcefully emit
    hyperlinks.

    Note that hyperlinks are only written when a path is also in the output
    and colors are enabled. To write hyperlinks without colors, you'll need
    to configure ripgrep to not colorize anything without actually
    disabling all ANSI escape codes completely:

        --colors 'path:none' \
        --colors 'line:none' \
        --colors 'column:none' \
        --colors 'match:none'

    ripgrep works this way because it treats the --color flag as a proxy
    for whether ANSI escape codes should be used at all. This means that
    environment variables like NO_COLOR=1 and TERM=dumb not only disable
    colors, but hyperlinks as well. Similarly, colors and hyperlinks are
    disabled when ripgrep is not writing to a tty. (Unless one forces the
    issue by setting --color=always.)

    If you're searching a file directly, for example:

        rg foo path/to/file

    then hyperlinks will not be emitted since the path given does not
    appear in the output. To make the path appear, and thus also a
    hyperlink, use the -H/--with-filename flag.

    For more information on hyperlinks in terminal emulators, see:
    https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda

--include-zero
    When used with -c/--count or --count-matches, this causes ripgrep to
    print the number of matches for each file even if there were zero
    matches. This is disabled by default but can be enabled to make ripgrep
    behave more like grep.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-include-zero.

--line-buffered
    When enabled, ripgrep will always use line buffering. That is, whenever
    a matching line is found, it will be flushed to stdout immediately.
    This is the default when ripgrep's stdout is connected to a tty, but
    otherwise, ripgrep will use block buffering, which is typically faster.
    This flag forces ripgrep to use line buffering even if it would
    otherwise use block buffering. This is typically useful in shell
    pipelines, for example:

        tail -f something.log | rg foo --line-buffered | rg bar

    This overrides the --block-buffered flag.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-line-buffered.

-n, --line-number
    Show line numbers (1-based).

    This is enabled by default when stdout is connected to a tty.

    This flag can be disabled by -N/--no-line-number.

-N, --no-line-number
    Suppress line numbers.

    Line numbers are off by default when stdout is not connected to a tty.

    Line numbers can be forcefully turned on by -n/--line-number.

-M NUM, --max-columns=NUM
    When given, ripgrep will omit lines longer than this limit in bytes.
    Instead of printing long lines, only the number of matches in that line
    is printed.

    When this flag is omitted or is set to 0, then it has no effect.

--max-columns-preview
    Prints a preview for lines exceeding the configured max column limit.

    When the -M/--max-columns flag is used, ripgrep will by default
    completely replace any line that is too long with a message indicating
    that a matching line was removed. When this flag is combined with
    -M/--max-columns, a preview of the line (corresponding to the limit
    size) is shown instead, where the part of the line exceeding the limit
    is not shown.

    If the -M/--max-columns flag is not set, then this has no effect.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-max-columns-preview.

-0, --null
    Whenever a file path is printed, follow it with a NUL byte. This
    includes printing file paths before matches, and when printing a list
    of matching files such as with -c/--count, -l/--files-with-matches and
    --files. This option is useful for use with xargs.

-o, --only-matching
    Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each
    such part on a separate output line.

--path-separator=SEPARATOR
    Set the path separator to use when printing file paths. This defaults
    to your platform's path separator, which is / on Unix and \ on Windows.
    This flag is intended for overriding the default when the environment
    demands it (e.g., cygwin). A path separator is limited to a single
    byte.

    Setting this flag to an empty string reverts it to its default
    behavior. That is, the path separator is automatically chosen based on
    the environment.

--passthru
    Print both matching and non-matching lines.

    Another way to achieve a similar effect is by modifying your pattern to
    match the empty string. For example, if you are searching using rg foo,
    then using rg '^|foo' instead will emit every line in every file
    searched, but only occurrences of foo will be highlighted. This flag
    enables the same behavior without needing to modify the pattern.

    An alternative spelling for this flag is --passthrough.

    This overrides the -C/--context, -A/--after-context and
    -B/--before-context flags.

-p, --pretty
    This is a convenience alias for --color=always --heading --line-number.
    This flag is useful when you still want pretty output even if you're
    piping ripgrep to another program or file. For example: rg -p foo |
    less -R.

-q, --quiet
    Do not print anything to stdout. If a match is found in a file, then
    ripgrep will stop searching. This is useful when ripgrep is used only
    for its exit code (which will be an error code if no matches are
    found).

    When --files is used, ripgrep will stop finding files after finding the
    first file that does not match any ignore rules.

-r REPLACEMENT, --replace=REPLACEMENT
    Replaces every match with the text given when printing results. Neither
    this flag nor any other ripgrep flag will modify your files.

    Capture group indices (e.g., $5) and names (e.g., $foo) are supported
    in the replacement string. Capture group indices are numbered based on
    the position of the opening parenthesis of the group, where the
    leftmost such group is $1. The special $0 group corresponds to the
    entire match.

    The name of a group is formed by taking the longest string of letters,
    numbers and underscores (i.e. [_0-9A-Za-z]) after the $. For example,
    $1a will be replaced with the group named 1a, not the group at index 1.
    If the group's name contains characters that aren't letters, numbers or
    underscores, or you want to immediately follow the group with another
    string, the name should be put inside braces. For example, ${1}a will
    take the content of the group at index 1 and append a to the end of it.

    If an index or name does not refer to a valid capture group, it will be
    replaced with an empty string.

    In shells such as Bash and zsh, you should wrap the pattern in single
    quotes instead of double quotes. Otherwise, capture group indices will
    be replaced by expanded shell variables which will most likely be
    empty.

    To write a literal $, use $$.

    Note that the replacement by default replaces each match, and not the
    entire line. To replace the entire line, you should match the entire
    line.

    This flag can be used with the -o/--only-matching flag.

--sort=SORTBY
    This flag enables sorting of results in ascending order. The possible
    values for this flag are:

    none: (Default) Do not sort results. Fastest. Can be multi-threaded.

    path: Sort by file path. Always single-threaded. The order is
    determined by sorting files in each directory entry during traversal.
    This means that given the files a/b and a+, the latter will sort after
    the former even though + would normally sort before /.

    modified: Sort by the last modified time on a file. Always
    single-threaded.

    accessed: Sort by the last accessed time on a file. Always
    single-threaded.

    created: Sort by the creation time on a file. Always single-threaded.

    If the chosen (manually or by-default) sorting criteria isn't available
    on your system (for example, creation time is not available on ext4
    file systems), then ripgrep will attempt to detect this, print an error
    and exit without searching.

    To sort results in reverse or descending order, use the --sortr flag.
    Also, this flag overrides --sortr.

    Note that sorting results currently always forces ripgrep to abandon
    parallelism and run in a single thread.

--sortr=SORTBY
    This flag enables sorting of results in descending order. The possible
    values for this flag are:

    none: (Default) Do not sort results. Fastest. Can be multi-threaded.

    path: Sort by file path. Always single-threaded. The order is
    determined by sorting files in each directory entry during traversal.
    This means that given the files a/b and a+, the latter will sort before
    the former even though + would normally sort after / when doing a
    reverse lexicographic sort.

    modified: Sort by the last modified time on a file. Always
    single-threaded.

    accessed: Sort by the last accessed time on a file. Always
    single-threaded.

    created: Sort by the creation time on a file. Always single-threaded.

    If the chosen (manually or by-default) sorting criteria isn't available
    on your system (for example, creation time is not available on ext4
    file systems), then ripgrep will attempt to detect this, print an error
    and exit without searching.

    To sort results in ascending order, use the --sort flag. Also, this
    flag overrides --sort.

    Note that sorting results currently always forces ripgrep to abandon
    parallelism and run in a single thread.

--trim
    When set, all ASCII whitespace at the beginning of each line printed
    will be removed.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-trim.

--vimgrep
    This flag instructs ripgrep to print results with every match on its
    own line, including line numbers and column numbers.

    With this option, a line with more than one match will be printed in
    its entirety more than once. For that reason, the total amount of
    output as a result of this flag can be quadratic in the size of the
    input. For example, if the pattern matches every byte in an input file,
    then each line will be repeated for every byte matched. For this
    reason, users should only use this flag when there is no other choice.
    Editor integrations should prefer some other way of reading results
    from ripgrep, such as via the --json flag. One alternative to avoiding
    exorbitant memory usage is to force ripgrep into single threaded mode
    with the -j/--threads flag. Note though that this will not impact the
    total size of the output, just the heap memory that ripgrep will use.

-H, --with-filename
    This flag instructs ripgrep to print the file path for each matching
    line. This is the default when more than one file is searched. If
    --heading is enabled (the default when printing to a tty), the file
    path will be shown above clusters of matches from each file; otherwise,
    the file name will be shown as a prefix for each matched line.

    This flag overrides -I/--no-filename.

-I, --no-filename
    This flag instructs ripgrep to never print the file path with each
    matching line. This is the default when ripgrep is explicitly
    instructed to search one file or stdin.

    This flag overrides -H/--with-filename.

--sort-files
    DEPRECATED. Use --sort=path instead.

    This flag instructs ripgrep to sort search results by file path
    lexicographically in ascending order. Note that this currently disables
    all parallelism and runs search in a single thread.

    This flag overrides --sort and --sortr.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-sort-files.
</code></pre>
<p>OUTPUT MODES:
-c, --count
This flag suppresses normal output and shows the number of lines that
match the given patterns for each file searched. Each file containing a
match has its path and count printed on each line. Note that unless
-U/--multiline is enabled, this reports the number of lines that match
and not the total number of matches. In multiline mode, -c/--count is
equivalent to --count-matches.</p>
<pre><code>    If only one file is given to ripgrep, then only the count is printed if
    there is a match. The -H/--with-filename flag can be used to force
    printing the file path in this case. If you need a count to be printed
    regardless of whether there is a match, then use --include-zero.

    This overrides the --count-matches flag. Note that when -c/--count is
    combined with -o/--only-matching, then ripgrep behaves as if
    --count-matches was given.

--count-matches
    This flag suppresses normal output and shows the number of individual
    matches of the given patterns for each file searched. Each file
    containing matches has its path and match count printed on each line.
    Note that this reports the total number of individual matches and not
    the number of lines that match.

    If only one file is given to ripgrep, then only the count is printed if
    there is a match. The -H/--with-filename flag can be used to force
    printing the file path in this case.

    This overrides the -c/--count flag. Note that when -c/--count is
    combined with -o/--only-matching, then ripgrep behaves as if
    --count-matches was given.

-l, --files-with-matches
    Print only the paths with at least one match and suppress match
    contents.

    This overrides --files-without-match.

--files-without-match
    Print the paths that contain zero matches and suppress match contents.

    This overrides -l/--files-with-matches.

--json
    Enable printing results in a JSON Lines format.

    When this flag is provided, ripgrep will emit a sequence of messages,
    each encoded as a JSON object, where there are five different message
    types:

    begin: A message that indicates a file is being searched and contains
    at least one match.

    end: A message the indicates a file is done being searched. This
    message also include summary statistics about the search for a
    particular file.

    match: A message that indicates a match was found. This includes the
    text and offsets of the match.

    context: A message that indicates a contextual line was found. This
    includes the text of the line, along with any match information if the
    search was inverted.

    summary: The final message emitted by ripgrep that contains summary
    statistics about the search across all files.

    Since file paths or the contents of files are not guaranteed to be
    valid UTF-8 and JSON itself must be representable by a Unicode
    encoding, ripgrep will emit all data elements as objects with one of
    two keys: text or bytes. text is a normal JSON string when the data is
    valid UTF-8 while bytes is the base64 encoded contents of the data.

    The JSON Lines format is only supported for showing search results. It
    cannot be used with other flags that emit other types of output, such
    as --files, -l/--files-with-matches, --files-without-match, -c/--count
    or --count-matches. ripgrep will report an error if any of the
    aforementioned flags are used in concert with --json.

    Other flags that control aspects of the standard output such as
    -o/--only-matching, --heading, -r/--replace, -M/--max-columns, etc.,
    have no effect when --json is set. However, enabling JSON output will
    always implicitly and unconditionally enable --stats.

    A more complete description of the JSON format used can be found here:
    https://docs.rs/grep-printer/*/grep_printer/struct.JSON.html.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-json.
</code></pre>
<p>LOGGING OPTIONS:
--debug
Show debug messages. Please use this when filing a bug report.</p>
<pre><code>    The --debug flag is generally useful for figuring out why ripgrep
    skipped searching a particular file. The debug messages should mention
    all files skipped and why they were skipped.

    To get even more debug output, use the --trace flag, which implies
    --debug along with additional trace data.

--no-ignore-messages
    When this flag is enabled, all error messages related to parsing ignore
    files are suppressed. By default, error messages are printed to stderr.
    In cases where these errors are expected, this flag can be used to
    avoid seeing the noise produced by the messages.

    This flag can be disabled with --ignore-messages.

--no-messages
    This flag suppresses some error messages. Specifically, messages
    related to the failed opening and reading of files. Error messages
    related to the syntax of the pattern are still shown.

    This flag can be disabled with --messages.

--stats
    When enabled, ripgrep will print aggregate statistics about the search.
    When this flag is present, ripgrep will print at least the following
    stats to stdout at the end of the search: number of matched lines,
    number of files with matches, number of files searched, and the time
    taken for the entire search to complete.

    This set of aggregate statistics may expand over time.

    This flag is always and implicitly enabled when --json is used.

    Note that this flag has no effect if --files, -l/--files-with-matches
    or --files-without-match is passed.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-stats.

--trace
    Show trace messages. This shows even more detail than the --debug flag.
    Generally, one should only use this if --debug doesn't emit the
    information you're looking for.
</code></pre>
<p>OTHER BEHAVIORS:
--files
Print each file that would be searched without actually performing the
search. This is useful to determine whether a particular file is being
searched or not.</p>
<pre><code>    This overrides --type-list.

--generate=KIND
    This flag instructs ripgrep to generate some special kind of output
    identified by KIND and then quit without searching. KIND can be one of
    the following values:

    man: Generates a manual page for ripgrep in the roff format.

    complete-bash: Generates a completion script for the bash shell.

    complete-zsh: Generates a completion script for the zsh shell.

    complete-fish: Generates a completion script for the fish shell.

    complete-powershell: Generates a completion script for PowerShell.

    The output is written to stdout. The list above may expand over time.

--no-config
    When set, ripgrep will never read configuration files. When this flag
    is present, ripgrep will not respect the RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH
    environment variable.

    If ripgrep ever grows a feature to automatically read configuration
    files in pre-defined locations, then this flag will also disable that
    behavior as well.

--pcre2-version
    When this flag is present, ripgrep will print the version of PCRE2 in
    use, along with other information, and then exit. If PCRE2 is not
    available, then ripgrep will print an error message and exit with an
    error code.

--type-list
    Show all supported file types and their corresponding globs. This takes
    any --type-add and --type-clear flags given into account. Each type is
    printed on its own line, followed by a : and then a comma-delimited
    list of globs for that type on the same line.

-V, --version
    This flag prints ripgrep's version. This also may print other relevant
    information, such as the presence of target specific optimizations and

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Basic Search</strong><br />
<code>rg "search_term" /path/to/directory</code><br />
Searches for "search_term" in all files under the specified directory (recursive by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Case-Insensitive Search</strong><br />
<code>rg -i "search_term"</code><br />
Ignores case distinctions (e.g., matches "Search_Term" or "SEARCH_TERM").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Case-Sensitive Search</strong><br />
<code>rg -s "Search_Term"</code><br />
Forces a case-sensitive match (default behavior if the query contains uppercase letters).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whole-Word Match</strong><br />
<code>rg -w "word"</code><br />
Matches "word" only when it appears as a full word (e.g., matches "word" but not "sword").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search in Specific File Types</strong><br />
<code>rg -t markdown "TODO"</code><br />
Searches for "TODO" only in Markdown files (<code>.md</code>/<code>.markdown</code>). Use <code>-t py</code> for Python files, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exclude Files/Directories</strong><br />
<code>rg "term" --glob "!node_modules"</code><br />
Excludes files in <code>node_modules</code> from the search. Use <code>--glob '*.log'</code> to exclude <code>.log</code> files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search Hidden Files</strong><br />
<code>rg -u "hidden_term"</code><br />
Includes hidden files and directories (e.g., <code>.config</code>, <code>.gitignore</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show Context Around Matches</strong><br />
<code>rg -C 3 "error"</code><br />
Displays 3 lines of context before and after each match. Use <code>-A 2</code> for 2 lines after or <code>-B 1</code> for 1 line before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>List Matching Files Only</strong><br />
<code>rg -l "pattern"</code><br />
Prints only filenames containing the pattern (no actual match text).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invert Match (Exclude Lines)</strong><br />
<code>rg -v "debug"</code><br />
Shows lines that <strong>do not</strong> contain "debug".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiline Search</strong><br />
<code>rg -U "start.*\n.*end"</code><br />
Enables multiline mode to match patterns across line breaks (e.g., <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> on separate lines).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Expression Search</strong><br />
<code>rg "^\d{3}-\d{4}"</code><br />
Uses regex to find patterns like a phone number (e.g., <code>123-4567</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search and Replace (with Sed)</strong><br />
<code>rg "old_text" -l | xargs sed -i 's/old_text/new_text/g'</code><br />
Lists files containing "old_text" and replaces it with "new_text" using <code>sed</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Ignore .gitignore Rules</strong><br />
<code>rg --no-ignore "password"</code><br />
Searches files ignored by <code>.gitignore</code>/<code>.rgignore</code> (e.g., <code>node_modules</code>, <code>.env</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search for Predefined Patterns</strong><br />
<code>rg --type-add 'foo:*.{foo,bar}' --type foo 'pattern'</code><br />
Defines a custom file type <code>foo</code> and searches for "pattern" in <code>.foo</code>/<code>.bar</code> files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limit Search Depth</strong><br />
<code>rg --max-depth 2 "term"</code><br />
Restricts recursion to 2 subdirectories deep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow Symbolic Links</strong><br />
<code>rg -L "term"</code><br />
Follows symlinks during the search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Count Matches</strong><br />
<code>rg -c "warning"</code><br />
Shows the count of matches per file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line endings</strong><br />
<code>rg "\.jpg$"</code><br />
\. ‚Üí Matches a literal dot (.).<br />
jpg ‚Üí Matches the string "jpg".<br />
$ ‚Üí Anchors the match to the end of the line.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Containing numbers</strong><br />
<code>rg "\d+"</code><br />
\d ‚Üí Matches any digit (0-9).<br />
+ ‚Üí Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character (\d).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find email</strong>
<code>rg "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,}"</code></p>
<pre><code> [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+ ‚Üí Matches the username part (letters, numbers,

<code>rg "test.*"</code><br />
test ‚Üí Matches the string "test".<br />
.* ‚Üí Matches zero or more occurrences of any character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exact character number match</strong>
<code>rg "\b\w{5}\b"</code><br />
\b ‚Üí Matches a word boundary (ensures full-word match).<br />
\w{5} ‚Üí Matches exactly 5 word characters (letters, digits, underscore).<br />

<h2 id="common-options-for-ripgrep"><a class="header" href="#common-options-for-ripgrep">Common options for ripgrep</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-i --ignore-case</code>: When searching for a pattern, ignore case differences. That is <code>rg -i fast</code> matches <code>fast</code>, <code>fASt</code>, <code>FAST</code>, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-S --smart-case</code>: This is similar to <code>--ignore-case</code>, but disables itself if the pattern contains any uppercase letters. Usually this flag is put into alias or a config file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-F --fixed-strings</code>: Disable regular expression matching and treat the pattern as a literal string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-w --word-regexp</code>: Require that all matches of the pattern be surrounded by word boundaries. That is, given <code>pattern</code>, the <code>--word-regexp</code> flag will cause ripgrep to behave as if <code>pattern</code> were actually <code>\b(?:pattern)\b</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-c --count</code>: Report a count of total matched lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-l --files-with-matches</code>: Only print the names of files that contain matches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--files-without-match</code>: Only print the names of files that do not contain matches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--files</code>: Print the files that ripgrep <em>would</em> search, but don't actually search them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-a --text</code>: Search binary files as if they were plain text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-U --multiline</code>: Permit matches to span multiple lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-z --search-zip</code>: Search compressed files (gzip, bzip2, lzma, xz, lz4, brotli, zstd). This is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-C --context</code>: Show the lines surrounding a match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--sort path</code>: Force ripgrep to sort its output by file name. (This disables parallelism, so it might be slower.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-L --follow</code>: Follow symbolic links while recursively searching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-M --max-columns</code>: Limit the length of lines printed by ripgrep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--debug</code>: Shows ripgrep's debug output. This is useful for understanding why a particular file might be ignored from search, or what kinds of configuration ripgrep is loading from the environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
